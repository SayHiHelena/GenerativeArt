# Generative Art Projects

My journey of creating interactive generative art pieces started with a uni subject called Design Programming.

Some creative coding / generative art projects for fun: 
1. [The Spirit of Flowers](https://github.com/SayHiHelena/GenerativeArt/tree/main/A3_The_Spirit_of_Flowers)
2. [Zen Garden](https://github.com/SayHiHelena/GenerativeArt/tree/main/Zen_Garden)
3. [Olympic tile pattern generator](https://github.com/SayHiHelena/GenerativeArt/tree/main/OlympicTilePattern)
4. The Window
